// This is a briew overview on how to use the position commands for creating Trigger and ObjMarker positions
// You will use the following commands;

EnableZFactor = Enable/Disable ZPos as a factor for the coordinates

// If you want to have the players vertical position as a factor, set this to 1
// Best used for maps with lots of verticality in order to avoid triggering positions
// Above or below the player

MarkObjSpot = Create a coordinate position for the ObjMarker (the orange icon)

// To best use this command, aim at the ground
// Aiming at the wall or an elevated position may cause incorrect positioning

MarkObjPos1/2 = Mark the corners of a ObjTriggerSpot to create a rectangular position

// I recommend having the position be very lenient, to ensure the player properly triggers the objective
// To best explain it, imagine this:

// You are in a perfectly square room
// The Objective Marker goes in the center of the room
// MarkObjPos1 should be positioned against the North-East/West corner
// MarkObjPos2 should be positioned against the South-West/East corner (directly opposite to where MarkObjPos1 is)

CreateObjPos = Create the formatted position

// This requires both MarkObjPos' to be used, and a CurObjSpot to be marked
// This will automatically create a formatted coordinates prompt in the console

CreateTriggerSpot = This will create a CurObjTriggerSpot based on the MarkObjPos you've set up

// This does not require a CurObjmarker to be set

MarkSubObjSpot = Create a coordinate position for the green marker

// This should be aimed at the object or wall you want to signify as an object of interest
// Unlike the CurObjMarker, this position puts the marker directly on the position you marked
